### Overview 

According to the World Health Organization, more than 42% medication errors are caused by doctors because experts write the prescription according to their experiences which are quite limited. With the advancement of technology and data analytic technique such as data mining and recommender systems, it is possibilities to explore potential knowledge from diagnosis history records and help doctors to prescribe medication correctly. A recommendation of right medicine based on diagnosis can target healing and decreasing trial-and-error when prescribing drugs. This can may further decrease undesirable drug side-effects. Therefore, in this project, we developed two recommender systems that can give a medical recommendation with an excellent efficiency and accuracy based on diagnosis and symptoms. 

#### Limitations

Team SPARC is aware that this recommendation system will not be quite accurate since we are not specialist to say one medicine can indeed be recommended instead of another, nor can an performance test be conducted at this time. In addition, there is the limitation on data avabliable, for instance, there is no patient information, true diagnosis, cost of medicine, the insurance company that covers the specific type of drug, etc since these are not easily obtainable. Therefore, our model is thought as a basis in the right direction, and with more data, the better the recommendation can become.

### Methodology   
#### Approaching the Problem  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Team SPARC aims to design medical recommender systems that applies supervised learning algorithms. In Machine Learning, tree-based techniques and Bayesian Classifier are popular tools to build prediction models. Decision trees and Bayesian can be intuitively understood as classifying different groups (labels), given their theories. By utilizing Naive Bayesian Classifier method, a medicine recommender system was developed in which users input the area of the body they are experiencing symptom, the kind of symptom, and the system would then recommend highly effective drugs that can treat such illness. The other system utilizes the decision tree algorithm to predict the events that can lead diabetic patients to a change in their medication.

Moreover, statistical inferences were performed to investigate the following:

1. A sentimental analysis was conducted to examine how well, or not so well, drug ratings are actually reflective of their effectiveness and side effects.
2. A statistic test to understand how drug benefits and side effects affect actual drug rating scores.

head(Drugs_summary)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
qqnorm(dataset$rating)
qqline(dataset$rating)
```

Given a patient claim that a drug is ‘Extremely Effective’, with a 95% confidence calculate the probability of a drug having ‘No SideEffect’
 
```{r}
highlyEffectiveDrugs <- subset(dataset, effectiveness=="Highly Effective")
meanRating <- mean(highlyEffectiveDrugs$rating)
sdRating <- sd(highlyEffectiveDrugs$rating)
noSideEffectDrugs <- subset(highlyEffectiveDrugs, sideEffects=='No Side Effects')
p <- nrow(noSideEffectDrugs)/nrow(highlyEffectiveDrugs)
n <- nrow(highlyEffectiveDrugs)
SE<- sqrt(p * (1-p)/n)
CILower <- p - 1.96 * SE
CIUpper <- p + 1.96 * SE
c(CILower, CIUpper)
```

Thus, with 95% confidence, it can be confirmed that given a drug is rated ‘Extremely Effective’, the probability of drug having ‘No Side Effect’ between 0.3750536 and 0.4210406

</details>

> Kruskal-Wallis H test

In the Drug Review data set, there are different ratings provided by the patients for each drug based on the experiences they have with it. Patient can assign the drug effectiveiness varying from 'Ineffective' to 'Highly Effective', the side effects from 'No Side effects' to 'Extremely Severe Side Effects' and a rating from 1 to 10. After performing exploratory data analysis to obtain insights about the data on patient rating, effectiveness and side effects distributions, the histograms and QQ plots revealed that the variables do not follow a normal distribution. Therefore, the hypothesis of whether or not an extremely effective drug means a high rated drug will be tested through the Kruskal-Wallis H test.

Kruskal-Wallis is a rank-based nonparametric test that can be used to determine if there are statistically significant differences between two or more groups of an independent variable on a continuous or ordinal dependent variable. It is considered the nonparametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA, and an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test to allow the comparison of more than two independent groups. 

The testing hypothesis is:

$H_0$ = An extremely effective drug means a high rated drug  
$H_1$ = An extremely effective drug is not necessarily a high rated drug

```{r}
kruskal.test(dataset$rating ~ dataset$effectiveness)
```

From the above, since the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, an extremely effective drug is not necessarily a high rated drug. 

> Dunn Test for Multiple Comparisons 

Since the Kruskal–Wallis test is significant, two post-hoc analyses were performed to determine which levels of the independent variable differ from each other level. Probably the most popular test for this is the Dunn test, which is performed with the `dunnTest` function in the FSA package Adjustments to the p-values could be made using the method option to control the familywise error rate or to control the false discovery rate. 

The Dunn test is appropriate for groups with unequal numbers of observations.

```{r}
drug.dunn = dunnTest(dataset$rating ~ dataset$effectiveness, method = "bonferroni")
drug.dunn
```

Since the dataset has several values to compare, it can be beneficial to have R convert this table to a compact letter display for you.  The `cldList` function in the rcompanion package can do this.

```{r include=FALSE}
drug.dunn = drug.dunn$res
drug.dunn
```


```{r}
cldList(comparison = drug.dunn$Comparison, p.value = drug.dunn$P.adj, threshold  = 0.05)
```

As we see, all the 5 levels of effectiveness have different letters, therefore, they are significant and independent of each other.

> Pairwise Mann–Whitney U-tests 

Another post-hoc approach is to use Pairwise Mann–Whitney U-tests. Mann–Whitney U-tests is also called the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. It is use to calculate pairwise comparisons between group levels with corrections for multiple testing. In order to prevent the inflation of Type I error rates, adjustments to the p-values can be made using the `p.adjust.method` option to control the familywise error rate or to control the false discovery rate.

If there are several values to compare, it can be beneficial to have R convert this table to a compact letter display for you. The multcompLetters function in the multcompView package can do this, but first the table of p-values must be converted to a full table.

```{r}
drug.wilcox = pairwise.wilcox.test(dataset$rating, dataset$effectiveness, p.adjust.method="none")
drug.wilcox
```

```{r}
drug.wilcox = drug.wilcox$p.value
drug.wilcox.table = fullPTable(drug.wilcox)
drug.wilcox.table
```

```{r}
multcompLetters(drug.wilcox.table, compare="<", threshold=0.05, Letters=letters, reversed = FALSE)
```

Values not sharing the same letter are significantly different. In this case , all the levels of effectiveness are significantly different.

And lastly, a chi-squared test is used to further examine if effectiveness is independent of as the rating changes at 0.05 significance level. Here, the hypothesis is:

$H_0$ = The effectiveness review is independent of users' rating scores  
$H_1$ = The effectiveness review is not independent of users' rating scores  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
chi_test <- chisq.test(data.matrix(cbind(dataset$rating,dataset$effectiveness)))
chi_test
```

The results shows that the p-value > 0.05 significance level. This suggests that the null hypothesis that the effectiveness review is independent of users' rating scores cannot be rejected.

Overall, it is apparent that an extremely effective drug does not mean a highly rated drug. Therefore, it can stated that even if a drug is classified as 'Highly Effective' it does not necessarily means it is the right drug that can be suggested to a patient, since the patient may not have felt comfortable due to its side effects.

***
**Sentimental Analysis**  

***

Using the effectiveness and the side effects reviews from the Drug Reviews data, a sentimental analysis was done to identify the user's experiences with the specific drug. In this analysis, the lexicon AFINN words and associated ratings from Finn Årup Nielsen were used. Moreover, since the hypothesis testing found that some results would have an overall negative experience even though their drug ratings were very high, conditions were establish to reverse sentiment ratings if they are not accurate representations of the reviews. 

As a result, firstly, the reviews of drug benefits shows that there are more true (indicated in blue) positive sentiments for highly rated drugs than true negative sentiments for low rated drugs. However, the analysis did produced 15% of sentiments that are inaccurate representations of how the drug benefit review and drug rating are classified in this data set. That is, indicated in red, there are highly rated drugs with an overall negative sentiment score for their "benefits" reviews, and low rated drugs with positive "benefits" reviews.

Secondly, the review of drug side effect review shows that there are also more true positive sentiments for highly rated drugs than true negative sentiments for low rated drugs. Moreover, the analysis did produced 18% of sentiment that are inaccurate representations of how the drug side effect reviews and drug rating are classified in this data set.

Medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, but it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits. The benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as less symptoms or curing an infection. The risks, however, are some things unwanted or unexpected that could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as headaches, or more serious, such as liver damage. Thus, weighing the risks and making the choice to accept it in order to get the benefits you want.

#### Decision Tree 

A decision tree is a graphical representation that makes use of branching methodology to exemplify all possible outcomes of a decision, based on certain conditions. In a decision tree, the internal node represents a test on the attribute, each branch of the tree represents the outcome of the test and the leaf node represents a particular class label i.e. the decision made after computing all of the attributes. The classification rules are represented through the path from root to the leaf node. There are two types of Decision Trees:

* Classification Trees - These are considered as the default kind of decision trees used to separate a data set into different classes, based on the response variable. These are generally used when the response variable is categorical in nature.

* Regression Trees - When the response or target variable is continuous or numerical, regression trees are used. These are generally used in predictive type of problems when compared to classification.

These machine learning algorithms help make decisions under uncertainty and help you improve communication, as they present a visual representation of a decision situation. Decision tree machine learning algorithms help a data scientist capture the idea that if a different decision was taken, then how the operational nature of a situation or model would have changed intensely. Decision trees can be explained to anyone from a non-technical background as they are self-explanatory.It does not require making any assumption on the linearity in the data and hence can be used in circumstances where the parameters are non-linearly related. Drawbacks of using Decision Tree machine learning algorithms is that the more the number of decisions in a tree, less is the accuracy of any expected outcome. Thus, we split in a few trees. 

Applications of Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm  

* In finance for option pricing  
* Healthcare to identify at-risk patients and disease trends  

In this project, multiple tries were performed to correct over-fitting problem by pruning, i.e. to reduce the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances, thus making the tree less complex.

The first example had the splitting criteria of “time spent in hospital”, which separates the data into a set of nine cases, while in the second example, the splitting criteria was “patient A1c result”, which separates the data into a set of eight cases. Moreover, the graphs show what is the optimal level for the decision tree. Thus, pruning can be done with the appropriate complexity parameter (cp) of 0.0016 and 0.0048, respectively.

```{r}
printcp(rtree_fit1)
plotcp(rtree_fit1, lty = 3, col = 1)
rtree_fit1 <- prune(rtree_fit1, cp = 0.0016)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# rpart.plot(rtree_fit1, type = 5, extra = 100, branch.lty = 3, box.palette = "RdYlGn", tweak = 1.5)
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greeneyefirefly/MSDS-DATA-607-FinalProject/master/picture%201.png") 
```

```{r}
printcp(rtree_fit2)
plotcp(rtree_fit2, lty = 3, col = 1)
rtree_fit2 <- prune(rtree_fit2, cp = 0.0048)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}

#### Naive Bayesian Classifier 

Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. It assumes there is no dependency between the predictors. 

Naive Bayesian classifiers have several advantages:

* They are extremely fast for both training and prediction  
* They provide straightforward probabilistic prediction  
* They are often very easily interpretable  
* They have very few (if any) tunable parameters  

These advantages mean a naive Bayesian classifier is often a good choice as an initial baseline classification. It tend to perform especially well when the naive assumptions actually match the data but this is very rare in practice.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, by utilizing supervised learning algorithms, classification algorithms in Machine Learning allowed us to developed two recommender systems that can give a medical recommendation with an excellent efficiency and accuracy based on diagnosis and symptoms. With the Naive Bayes Classifier, it was do by an underlying probabilistic model, i.e. Bayes theorem, while with the decision trees it identify the most significant dimensions and interactions using regression models.

Advantages of Classification Algorithms

* It is easy to implement  
* Requires small amount of data to train model  
* Good results obtained in most of the cases  

Disadvantages of Classification Algorithms

* It’s assumption, class conditional independence else loss of accuracy
* If you have no occurrences of a class label and a certain attribute value together then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero


And so, our model can serve as a basis in the right direction, and with more data, the better the recommendation can become.

### Challenges & Solutions {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

* Computer systems were not able to handle the programming because to required too much memory, in addition to ram power.
    + More research on robust techniques were needed to build our model.

* How to reuse a model code.
    + Store model in MongoDB as R objects and load it when needed.
